## Description
Implementation of A* algorithm on a differential drive (non-holonomic) TurtleBot robot. Navigate a differential drive robot (TurtleBot) in a given  map environment from a given start point to a given goal point. Considered differential drive constraints while implementing the A* algorithm, with 8 set of action space. Checks the feasibility of all inputs/outputs (if user gives start and goal nodes that are in the obstacle space they will be informed by a message and they should try again). Code outputs an animation/video of optimal path generation between start and goal point on the map. It shows both the node exploration as well as the optimal path generated.

## Part 1: 2D turtlebot
Clone or download the project repository and open the Part1 folder,
**Test case 1:**
Input start location as shown in below fashion, **start_x_location,start_y_location,start_orientation** _space_ **goal_x_location,goal_y_location** _space_ **rpm1,rpm2,clearance**
Open terminal in the part1 folder and type below command:
```bash
python turtlebot_A_star.py -4,-4.5,0 4.25,2.75 30,25,5
```
or
```bash
python3 turtlebot_A_star.py -4,-4.5,0 4.25,2.75 30,25,5
```

**Output**
**Part1 testcase 1 visualization video:** [Test case 1](https://youtu.be/7hsKKAhZoWE).

**Test case 2:**
Input start location as shown in below fashion, **start_x_location,start_y_location,start_orientation** _space_ **goal_x_location,goal_y_location** _space_ **rpm1,rpm2,clearance**
Open terminal in the part1 folder and type below command:
```bash
python turtlebot_A_star.py -4,1,0 4.25,2.75 30,25,5
```
or
```bash
python3 turtlebot_A_star.py -4,1,0 4.25,2.75 30,25,5
```

## Part 2: 3D turtlebot
Traverse to location containing **proj3_ws**. This is the workspace that contains all the files necessary to run A* for Turtlebot3 in ROS-Gazebo. 
Once inside **proj3_ws**, type the following commands to prepare the files for execution:
```bash
cd ~(your location)/proj3_ws/
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```
If any errors pop up, **caktin_make** can be replaced by:
```bash
catkin_make -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3
```
Traverse into the package **proj3_gazebo** and run the 2D A* Program to generate wheel velocities for 3D implementation:
```bash
cd src/proj3_gazebo
python3 turtlebot_A_star.py -4,-4.5,0 4.25,2.75 30,25,5
```
To create an executable for **a_star_turtlebot_gazebo.py** located in **proj3_ws/src/proj3_gazebo/src/** , run the following command:
```bash
cd proj3_ws/src/proj3_gazebo/src/
chmod +x a_star_turtlebot_gazebo.py
```
To execute the launch file and view turtlebot in gazebo, run the following command:
```bash
roslaunch proj3_gazebo map.launch
```
If you wish to view output for different **start_x_location,start_y_location,start_orientation**, first generate the velocities by running **turtlebot_A_star.py** (as shown earlier) and change the following in the **map.launch** file located in  **proj3_ws/src/proj3_gazebo/launch/** in line 13,14,15:
```bash
13 <arg name="x_pos" default="(your start_x_location)"/>
14 <arg name="y_pos" default="(your start_y_location)"/>
15 <arg name="z_pos" default="(your start_orientation)"/>
```
NOTE: Be **absolutely** certain that the arguments entered while running the 2D implementation are the **same as the values entered in the launch file**.
